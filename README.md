### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA first involved exploring the data to answer these key questions in an attempt to start building an actionable roadmap for upcoming years:

- Which year had the highest profit?
- In the year with the highest profit, which month generated the most profit?
- Numerically, which country placed the most orders?
- For the year 2012, which product category had the highest shipping cost per unit?
- In 2013, which customer segment received the highest average discount rate?

Based on resulting answers from these initial lines of query, EDA went on to generate deeper findings mapped out on a comprehensive Excel dashboard.

### Findings

For the period 2011-2014, the primary analysis results are summarised as follows:

1. We can see that most of our sales were made in the United States.
2. Office supplies are the top-selling product category.
3. The Central region has the highest number of sales.
4. The highest profit was achieved in the LATAM region.
5. Categorically, we made the most profit from technological products.
6. Losses were incurred in the Africa, South Asia, and EMEA regions.
7. The Furniture category resulted in the highest losses.

### Recommendations

Based on this analysis, I recommend the following actions:

- We should reduce furniture sales in regions where we incurred losses and focus on promoting the technology category instead.
- Increasing the prices of items in the office supplies category could help boost profits.
- Consider expanding marketing efforts for technology products in the LATAM region to capitalize on its profitability.
- Reassess operations in Africa, South Asia, and EMEA to identify cost-saving opportunities or adjust the product mix to minimize losses.
